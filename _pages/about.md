Currently pursuing a master’s degree at the [School of Software](https://ruanjian.nwpu.edu.cn/), [Northwestern Polytechnical University]((https://en.nwpu.edu.cn/)), with a strong focus on Brain-Computer Interface (BCI), Neuroscience, Machine Learning, and Brain-signal Decoding. The research specializes in neural decoding, BCIs, and AI-driven neuroscience, particularly in developing advanced machine learning models, such as Transformer-based architectures, for EEG signal processing and neural data analysis. This work aims to advance brain-machine interaction technologies and leverage AI to better understand complex neural dynamics.

Several projects focus on designing novel EEG decoding models and developing generative neural signal simulations to enhance brain-computer interface efficiency. With a strong foundation in software engineering, machine learning, and neuroscience, this research pushes technological boundaries in the field.

I am interested in applying AI to neural signal processing and building large models that handle multimodal inputs like images, language, audio, and signals. This interdisciplinary approach, combining AI, neuroscience, and engineering, aims to broaden the application of large models in healthcare, neuroprosthetics, and beyond, advancing AI’s ability to process and interpret diverse data.
