Currently pursuing a masterâ€™s degree at the [School of Software](https://ruanjian.nwpu.edu.cn/), [Northwestern Polytechnical University]((https://en.nwpu.edu.cn/)), with a strong focus on Brain-Computer Interface (BCI), Neuroscience, Machine Learning, and Brain-signal Decoding. The research specializes in neural decoding, BCIs, and AI-driven neuroscience, particularly in developing advanced machine learning models, such as Transformer-based architectures, for EEG signal processing and neural data analysis. This work aims to advance brain-machine interaction technologies and leverage AI to better understand complex neural dynamics.

Several innovative projects have been undertaken, including the design of novel EEG decoding models and the development of generative neural signal simulations, with the objective of improving the efficiency of brain-computer interface systems. With a solid foundation in software engineering, machine learning, and neuroscience, the research is committed to pushing the boundaries of technology in this field.

Interdisciplinary collaboration is also emphasized, integrating artificial intelligence, neuroscience, and engineering to create impactful technologies with potential applications in healthcare, neuroprosthetics, and beyond.
