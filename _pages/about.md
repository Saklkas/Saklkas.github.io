 I am currently pursuing my masterâ€™s degree at the [School of Software](https://ruanjian.nwpu.edu.cn/), [Northwestern Polytechnical University](https://en.nwpu.edu.cn/). My academic journey has been deeply rooted in the fascinating fields of Brain-Computer Interface (BCI), Neuroscience, Machine Learning, and Brain-signal Decoding.

Throughout my studies, I have developed a profound interest in understanding the intricate workings of the human brain and how we can leverage technology to decode and interpret brain signals. My research primarily focuses on creating innovative solutions that bridge the gap between neuroscience and artificial intelligence, aiming to enhance human-computer interactions and improve the quality of life for individuals with neurological disorders.

In addition to my academic pursuits, I have actively participated in various research projects and collaborations, which have allowed me to apply theoretical knowledge to practical applications. These experiences have not only honed my technical skills but also fostered a collaborative spirit and a passion for continuous learning.
