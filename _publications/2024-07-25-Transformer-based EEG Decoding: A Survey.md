excerpt: 'Electroencephalography (EEG) is widely used to capture brain activity, and decoding EEG signals is crucial for brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). Traditional machine learning methods are being surpassed by deep learning, particularly Transformers, which excel in handling sequential data. This article reviews the latest applications of Transformers in EEG decoding, detailing their integration with other deep learning techniques and the evolution of model architectures. It also discusses the current challenges and future prospects in this rapidly evolving field, aiming to provide insights and guidance for future research.'
