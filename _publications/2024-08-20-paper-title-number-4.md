excerpt: 'The study introduces a novel decoding architecture called the Dual-Branch Temporal-Spectral-Spatial Transformer (Dual-TSST) for decoding electroencephalography (EEG) signals. This architecture uses convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to extract temporal-spatial features from raw EEG data and temporal-spectral-spatial features from time-frequency domain data. These features are then integrated and processed by a transformer to capture global long-range dependencies in the non-stationary EEG signals, followed by classification using global average pooling and multi-layer perceptron blocks. The proposed method was evaluated on three public datasets (BCI IV 2a, BCI IV 2b, and SEED), achieving average accuracies of 80.67%, 88.64%, and 96.65%, respectively, outperforming over ten other state-of-the-art methods. This study highlights the potential of the Dual-TSST for high-performance EEG decoding and future CNN-Transformer applications.'
