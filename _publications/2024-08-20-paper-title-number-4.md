Decoding
excerpt: 'â€”The decoding of electroencephalography (EEG) 
signals allows access to user intentions conveniently, which plays 
an important role in the fields of human-machine interaction. To 
effectively extract sufficient characteristics of the multichannel 
EEG, a novel decoding architecture network with a dual-branch 
temporal-spectral-spatial transformer (Dual-TSST) is proposed 
in this study. Specifically, by utilizing convolutional neural 
networks (CNNs) on different branches, the proposed processing 
network first extracts the temporal-spatial features of the original 
EEG and the temporal-spectral-spatial features of time-frequency 
domain data converted by wavelet transformation, respectively. 
These perceived features are then integrated by a feature fusion 
block, serving as the input of the transformer to capture the global 
long-range dependencies entailed in the non-stationary EEG, and 
being classified via the global average pooling and multi-layer 
perceptron blocks. To evaluate the efficacy of the proposed 
approach, the competitive experiments are conducted on three 
publicly available datasets of BCI IV 2a, BCI IV 2b, and SEED, 
with the head-to-head comparison of more than ten other
state-of-the-art methods. As a result, our proposed Dual-TSST 
performs superiorly in various tasks, which achieves the 
promising EEG classification performance of average accuracy of 
80.67% in BCI IV 2a, 88.64% in BCI IV 2b, and 96.65% in SEED, 
respectively. Extensive ablation experiments conducted between 
the Dual-TSST and comparative baseline model also reveal the 
enhanced decoding performance with each module of our 
proposed method. This study provides a new approach to 
high-performance EEG decoding, and has great potential for 
future CNN-Transformer based applications. '
